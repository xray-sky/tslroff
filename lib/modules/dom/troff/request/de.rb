# .de xx yy     -         yy=..     -       Define or redefine the macro xx. The contents
#                                           of the macro begin on the next line. Input
#                                           lines are copied in copy mode until the
#                                           definition is terminated by a line beginning
#                                           with .yy, whereupon the macro yy is called.
#                                           In the absence of yy, the definition is
#                                           terminated by a line beginning with "..".
#                                           A macro may contain .de requests provided
#                                           the terminating macros differ or the contained
#                                           definition terminator is concealed; ".." can
#                                           be concealed as "\\.." which will copy as
#                                           "\.." and be reread as "..".
#
# wow. this works. go ruby!
#
# NOTE: despite the description, the default macro is a single dot. ('yy=.')
#       but '. (break suppressed) is not a valid termination.
#       explicitly setting 'yy=..' results in a terminating macro of '...'.
#       'yy=mm' equates to a terminating macro of '.mm'.
#
#    REVIEW does it work correctly with non-default delim?
