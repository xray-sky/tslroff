# TODO: ยง7.2 Copy mode input interpretation
#            During the definition and extension of strings and macros, the input is
#            read in copy mode. The input is copied without interpretation except that
#            * the contents of number registers, indicated by '\n', are substituted.
#            * Strings, indicated by '\*x' and '\*(xx', are read into the text.
#            * Arguments indicated by '\$' are replaced by the appropriate values at
#              the current macro level.
#            * Concealed new-lines indicated by '\(new-line)' are eliminated.
#            * Comments indicated by '\"' are eliminated.
#            * '\t' and '\a' are interpreted as ASCII horizontal tab and SOH respectively.
#            * '\\' is interpreted as '\'.
#            * '\.' is interpreted as '.'.
#            These interpretations can be suppressed by prepending a \. For example,
#            since \\ maps into a \, '\\n' will copy as '\n' which will be interpreted
#            as a number register indicator when the macro or string is reread.
#
# FIX: copy mode is currently expanding \\*(xx when it shouldn't be (double escaped)
