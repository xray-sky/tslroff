# .tr abcd...  none     -          O       Translate 'a' into 'b', 'c' into 'd', etc.
#                                          If an odd number of characters is given, the
#                                          last one will be mapped into the space
#                                          character. To be consistent, a particular
#                                          translation must stay in effect from input to
#                                          output time. To reset '.tr', follow request
#                                          with previous arguments given in duplicate.
#                                          The example given at the start of this entry,
#                                          for instance, would be turned off as follows:
#                                          '.tr aacc'.
#
# All text processing (e.g., character comparisons) takes place with the input
# (stand-in) character which appears to have the width of the final character. The
# graphic translation occurs at the moment of output (including diversions).
#
# Unfortunately this is not a strict one-to-one arrangement. Constructs like \& and \(**
# are allowed for the substituted "character". See csh(1) [GL2-W2.5] for example.
#
# TODO: apparently they're also allowed for the input character. .tr \(ts" appears in
#       eqn(1) [Rhapsody DR2]
#
# TODO: redo with get_char
