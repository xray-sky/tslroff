# .tr abcd...  none     -          O       Translate 'a' into 'b', 'c' into 'd', etc.
#                                          If an odd number of characters is given, the
#                                          last one will be mapped into the space
#                                          character. To be consistent, a particular
#                                          translation must stay in effect from input to
#                                          output time. To reset '.tr', follow request
#                                          with previous arguments given in duplicate.
#                                          The example given at the start of this entry,
#                                          for instance, would be turned off as follows:
#                                          '.tr aacc'.
#
# All text processing (e.g., character comparisons) takes place with the input
# (stand-in) character which appears to have the width of the final character. The
# graphic translation occurs at the moment of output (including diversions).
#
# This is not a strict one-to-one arrangement. Constructs like \& and \(**
# are allowed for the either the given or substituted character.
#
# See csh(1) [GL2-W2.5], eqn(1) [Rhapsody DR2] for examples.
#
#
# based on an infinite loop in ar(5) [SunOS 0.3] resulting from the combination of
# .tr *\(** and .ec % I infer (and observe from troff itself) that the escape is
# considered to have been processed at the moment of .tr and needn't still be active
# for the translation to be effective.
#
# This does _not_ extend to escapes in named strings however, nor the _input_ part
# of the equation. given .tr \(ts", no translation occurs if the escape char is
# changed, or escapes disabled entirely. (e.g. the "special character" \(ts is not
# the same thing as the four-character string "\(ts")
#
# To facilitate this behavior, we will use ASCII ESC to indicate a "permanent" escape
# for the output side. We should (SHOULD) never see an \x1B (\e) in legit input.
