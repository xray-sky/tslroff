#                                     nor adjusted. Input text lines are copied directly
#                                     to output text lines without regard for the current
#                                     line length.

# TODO: ยง4.2 The copying of an input line in no-fill mode can be interrupted by
#            terminating the partial line with a '\c'. The next encountered input
#            text line will be considered to be a continuation of the same line of input
#            text. If the intervening control lines cause a break, any partial line will
#            be forced out along with any partial word.
