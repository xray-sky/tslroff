# methods for tokenizing input lines
#
#  where there are many kinds of edge cases -
#  troff may treat \*(xx as a single character
#  and expressions like \f\P are equivalent to \fP (REVIEW: not according to os x nroff; \f is ignored and \P is copied)
#  and escapes may be escaped
#  and arbitrary sequences may be quoted, with quotes
#    enclosing other arbitrary quoted sequences, sometimes
#    even using the same quote characters.
#
# these methods are _not_ destructive of s
#

# \P counts as one character, as does \*(xx.
