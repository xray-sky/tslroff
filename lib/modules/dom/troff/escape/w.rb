#   definition of the \w (width function) escape
#
# The width function \w'string' generates the numerical width of string (in basic
# units). Size and font changes may be safely embedded in string, and will not affect
# the current environment. For example, .ti -\w'1. 'u could be used to temporarily
# indent leftward a distance equal to the size of the string "1. ".
#
# The width function also sets three number registers. The registers st and sb are
# set respectively to the highest and lowest extent of string relative to the baseline;
# then, for example, the total height of the string is \n(stu-\n(sbu. In troff the
# number register .ct is set to a value between 0 and 3; 0 means that all of the
# characters in string were short lower case characters without descenders (like "e");
# 1 means that at least one character has a descender (like "y"); 2 means that at least
# one character is tall (like "H"); and 3 means that both tall characters and characters
# with descenders are present.

# Tried a bunch of stuff to get faster results through selenium.
#  * specify user profile, instead of letting it generate one every time
#  * explicitly set various browser cache options
#  * get doc once, use javascript to replace element (to prevent repeated download/parse of css)
#  * find element with css selector instead of by id

# TODO "will not affect the current environment"
# TODO set number registers -- REVIEW is it necessary? (is it used in practice)
# REVIEW i'm in big trouble if I ever get a \w with a tab in it
# TODO consider implementing a selenium answer cache. even if it isn't persisted it ought to pay
#      dividends on pages with lots of tabs
#        e.g. SunPHIGS 1.1 currently runs 15min to process, without a cache
#             with the cache, appx. half that.
#             but I'm seeing problems with the cache apparently being poisoned by
#             results where the CSS did not load correctly?
