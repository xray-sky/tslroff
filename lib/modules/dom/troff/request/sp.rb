# .sp N    -        N=1V      B,โก,v   Space vertically in either direction. If 'N' is
#                                     negative, the motion is backward (upward) and is
#                                     limited to the distance to the top of the page.
#                                     Forward (downward) motion is truncated to the
#                                     distance to the nearest trap. If the no-space mode
#                                     is on, no spacing occurs (see '.ns' and '.rs').
#
# Blank text line   -         B       Causes a break and outputs a blank line exactly
#                                     like .sp 1.

# TODO negative motion, traps, no-space mode, unit scaling, etc.
# TODO for some reason (probably to reserve page space?) a.out(4) [GL2-W2.5] has
#           .sp 1i
#           .sp -1i
#       html is output "correctly" but it's not _useful_ to have a span with
#       negative height. now what? might just have to use the rewrite facility.

# TODO getting extra junk following .sp, messing with the spacing;
#      either "<p> </p>", or "<br /> <br />" - probably from space adjust?
