# In the following, c is a one-character, built-in condition name, ! signifies not,
# N is a numerical expression, string1 and string2 are strings delimited by any non-blank,
# non-numeric character not in the strings, and anything represents what is conditionally
# accepted.
#

#  form          value    argument
#
# .if c anything   -       -         -      If condition c true, accept anything as input;
#                                           in multi-line case use \{anything\}.
#
# .if !c anything  -       -         -      If condition c false, accept anything.
#
# .if N anything   -       -         -      If expression N > 0, accept anything.
#
# .if !N anything  -       -         -      If expression N โค 0, accept anything.
#
# .if 'string1'string2' anything     -      If string1 identical to string2, accept anything.
#
# .if !'string1'string2' anything    -      If string1 not identical to string2, accept anything.
#
#   The built-in condition names are
#      o      True if current page number is odd
#      e      True if current page number is even
#      t      True if formatter is troff
#      n      True if formatter is nroff
#
#   Any spaces between the condition and the beginning of anything are skipped over.
#   The anything can be either a single input line (text, macro, or whatever) or a number
#   of input lines. In the multi-line case, the first line must begin with a left delimiter
#   \{ and the last line must end with a right delimiter \}. The left delimiter must be
#   followed by either a command or text. Following the left delimiter with a backslash
#   (\{\), escaping the newline, yields an equivalent arrangement.
#
#
# I guess the string comparison delimiters are less restrictive than I expected.
# tmac.an gives examples of both ^G (BEL) and " as delimiters (GL2-W2.5, SunOS 5.5)
# and \(ts is used in mwm(1) [AOS 4.3], so "any" really does mean _any_.
