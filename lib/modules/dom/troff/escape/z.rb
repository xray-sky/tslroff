#   definition of the \z (non-spacing) escape
#
# XXX get_esc will have given us the next character to overstrike with, even though it's not
# XXX "officially" part of the \z escape
#
# get_esc will have given us the entire remainder of the string, even though it's not
# "officially" part of the \z escape, because we could have non-outputting escapes
# (font changes, vertical shifts) between the non-spacing character and what is printed
#  on top of it.
#
# examples:
#  scanf(3s)  [SunOS 2.0] - \z\fBe\v'1'f\v'-1'\fR"
#  erf(3m)    [SunOS 3.5] - \(is\d\s8\z0\s10\u\u\s8x
#  lgamma(3m) [SunOS 3.5] - \(is\d\s8\z0\s10\u\u\s8\(if
#
# units(1) [SunOS 2.0] uses "\z/\h'\w'*'u'" as a hack to get a / the same width as a *
# so we have a special case to do this, as otherwise the \h will give "alternate results"
#
# TODO
#   loss of all text following overstrike (from get_char/escape)
# âˆš loss of font changes during overstriking
#   don't use the Overstrike css, as it centers within the overall width.
#     \z is literally zero width. this matters with e.g. \(br
#
#   even this is not the whole story as scanf.3s [SunOS 2.0] uses "\z\fBe\v'1'f\v'-1'\fR"
#   to get a bold 'e' overstruck by vertically-displaced 'f' (...i think) so it's not
#   strictly true that two runs to get_char will cover us.
#   => I guess this is meant to give us the appearance of a two-line paragraph tag.
#      so it is maybe better to fix this as a rewrite and hope we never run into anything like
#      this again. only there's no way to insert the break at rewrite without closing the tag...
#   => our line-height: 0 css hack will totally prevent this from working! (maybe)
#   => also this (currently broken) Overstrike is not setting the output indicator
#
#  more dire straits:
#    erf(3m) [SunOS 3.5] uses "\(is\d\s8\z0\s10\u\u\s8x" to get bounds on an integral
#     => and we are losing the \s8 (the Overstrike is at regular font size)
#     => the page assumes the default font size is \s10 instead of using \s0 (separate issue)
#
#   lgamma(3m) [SunOS 3.5] same issue - "\(is\d\s8\z0\s10\u\u\s8\(if"
