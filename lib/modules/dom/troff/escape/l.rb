#   \l'Nc' draws a string of repeated characters 'c' toward the right for a distance of N
#   if c looks like a continuation of an expression for N, it may be insulated from N with
#   a \&. If c is not specified, the _ (baseline rule) is used. If N is negative, a
#   backward horizontal motion of size N is made before drawing the string. Any space
#   resulting from N/(size of c) having a remainder is put at the beginning (left end) of
#   the string. In the case of characters that are designed to be connected such as
#   baseline-rule, underrule, and root-en, the remainder space is covered by overlapping.
#   If N is less than the width of c, a single c is centered on a distance N. As an example,
#   a macro to underscore a string can be written
#
#     .de us
#     \\$1\ l ' | 0\(ul'
