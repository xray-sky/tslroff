# .ig yy           -       yy=..     -      .ig behaves exactly like .de except that the
#                                           input is discarded. The input is read in copy
#                                           mode, and any auto-incremented registers will
#                                           be affected.
#
# Note:
#  We will get a warning about an unrecognized request terminating an .ig that
#  did _not_ happen, due to .if -- this does not indicate a problem.
#  REVIEW ^^ still?
