#   definition of the \w (width function) escape
#
# The width function \w'string' generates the numerical width of string (in basic
# units). Size and font changes may be safely embedded in string, and will not affect
# the current environment. For example, .ti -\w'1. 'u could be used to temporarily
# indent leftward a distance equal to the size of the string "1. ".
#
# The width function also sets three number registers. The registers st and sb are
# set respectively to the highest and lowest extent of string relative to the baseline;
# then, for example, the total height of the string is \n(stu-\n(sbu. In troff the
# number register .ct is set to a value between 0 and 3; 0 means that all of the
# characters in string were short lower case characters without descenders (like "e");
# 1 means that at least one character has a descender (like "y"); 2 means that at least
# one character is tall (like "H"); and 3 means that both tall characters and characters
# with descenders are present.
