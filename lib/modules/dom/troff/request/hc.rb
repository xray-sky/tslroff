# is '\%' "a character"? does .hc ^ set it to '^' or '\^'?
#  => '.hc ^' appears to add '^' as discretionary hyphen, in addition to '\%'
#  => '.hc \q' appears to add 'q' as a discretionary hyphen, in addition to '\%'.
#     looks like '\q' is parsed into 'q' before assigning it as discretionary hyphen
#  => '.hc \(mu' is possible (TODO:)
