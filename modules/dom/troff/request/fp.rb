# .fp N F file  -         ignored   -       Font position. This is a statement that a
#                                           font named F is mounted on position N. It is
#                                           a fatal error if F is not known. Fonts and the
#                                           possible range of their numerical positions is
#                                           device dependent. .fp accepts a third optional
#                                           argument, file, which is an alternate version
#                                           of the font F.
