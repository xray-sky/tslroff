# TODO:
#   many pages have un-expanded SCCS ID keywords (%W% %Q% %Y% in the footer, in .NOP)
#   -- the formatted pages have values set for these, but where did they come from?
#      and are the formatted pages otherwise the same??
#      (No, in at least the case of section 5 pages with .so into /usr/include)
# âˆš apl.1 :: overstrikes -> I-beam is >2chr; character centers not aligned, e.g. lamp
#            might be best just to rewrite them as single chars, if possible
#   ms.7 :: [96] has ^A in input. why? formatted page shows no character output.
#           doc says "all other" characters are ignored -
#           printing ascii, SOH, HTAB, NL, BS passed through for output
#           SOH, STX, ETX, ENQ, ACK, BEL all suppressed for output in troff unless translated
#           "unless in copy mode, the ASCII backspace char is replaced by a backward horizontal
#            motion having the width of the space character."
