#                                     collected is stopped and the line is output without
#                                     adjustment. Text lines beginning with space
#                                     characters and empty text lines (blank lines) also
#                                     cause a break.

# REVIEW: the intersection of all these things needs closer look; on the AOS pages
#         there are lots of examples like adb(1), or bitprt(1) [ AOS 4.3 ]:
#           .nf
#              something
#           .br
#              something else
#           .br
#              third thing
#           .fi
#         where this is output with no extra space between any of the three lines.
