# The ASCII horizontal tab character and the ASCII SOH (hereinafter known as the leader
# character) can both be used to generate either horizontal motion or a string of
# repeated characters. The length of the generated entity is governed by internal tab
# stops specifiable with .ta. The default difference is that tabs generate motion and
# leaders generate a string of periods; .tc and .lc offer the choice of repeated character
# or motion. There are three types of internal tab stops---left adjusting, right adjusting,
# and centering. in the following table D is the distance from the current position on
# the input line (where a tab or leader was found) to the next tab stop; next-string
# consists of the input characters following the tab (or leader) up to the next tab
# (or leader) or end of line, and W is the width of next-string
#
#     Tab    | Legnth of motion or |    Location of
#     type   | repeated characters |    next-string
#  ----------|---------------------|----------------------------
#     Left   |           D         | Following D
#    Right   |         D - W       | Right adjusted within D
#   Centered |       D - W / 2     | Centered on right end of D
#
# The length of generated motion is allowed to be negative, but that of a repeated
# character string cannot be. Repeated character strings contain an integer number of
# characters, and any residual distance is prepended as motion. Tabs or leaders found
# after the last tab are ignored, but may be used as next-string terminators.
#
# Tabs and leaders are not interpreted in copy-mode. \t and \a always generate a
# non-interpreted tab and leader respectively, and are equivalent to actual tabs and
# leaders in copy mode but are ignored during output mode.
#
#  REVIEW what happens when given not-an-N as arg (invalid expression)
#         ignored, I think, which means bad interaction from to_u returning '0' in that case
#
# TODO initialize properly
# TODO justifications (right/centered)
# TODO what really happens when you get
#        .ta 0.5i 1.0i 1.5i
#        \tfoo\tbar\t\tbaz
#      e.g. more tabs in input than currently defined - rwhod(1m) [GL2-W2.5]
#      nroff just piles everything in, with no whitespace between
# TODO are comma-separated tabs legit? they seem to not be unusual. but, see above re: more tabs?
