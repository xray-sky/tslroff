# .sp N    -        N=1V      B,v     Space vertically in either direction. If 'N' is
#                                     negative, the motion is backward (upward) and is
#                                     limited to the distance to the top of the page.
#                                     Forward (downward) motion is truncated to the
#                                     distance to the nearest trap. If the no-space mode
#                                     is on, no spacing occurs (see '.ns' and '.rs').
#
# TODO: negative motion, traps, no-space mode, unit scaling, etc.
# REVIEW: Looks like .sp is meant to cause a break. But I'm not sure.
# REVIEW: is this better accomplished with baseline-shift??
