# .so file      -         -         -       Switch source file. The top input (file reading)
#                                           level is switched to file. When the new file
#                                           ends, input is again taken from the original
#                                           file; .so's may be nested. Note that file should
#                                           be preprocessed, if necessary, before being
#                                           called by .so. eqn, tbl, pic, and grap will
#                                           not reach through .sos to process an object
#                                           file. Once a .so is encountered, the processing
#                                           of file is immediate. Processing of the original
#                                           file (e.g., a macro that is still active) is
#                                           suspended.
