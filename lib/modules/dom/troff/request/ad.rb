#                                     margin will be ragged. The adjustment type for .ad
#                                     is not changed. Output line filling still occurs if

#                                     adjustment will be deferred until fill mode is back
#                                     on. If the type indicator c is present, the adjustment
#                                     type is changed as shown in the following table.
